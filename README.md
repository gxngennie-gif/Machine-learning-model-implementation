#Description of the task
*PROJECT TITLE*
Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)

*PROJECT DESCRIPTION*
This project focuses on implementing a Machine Learning model to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using the Scikit-Learn library in Python. The objective of the project is to build a predictive model that can automatically detect unwanted spam messages based on text data.
The model was developed using Python in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The dataset used contains labeled email messages categorized as “spam” or “ham”.

#TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED
Python 3.13
VS Code (Development Environment)
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
Pandas (Data handling)
NumPy (Numerical operations)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning model implementation)
CountVectorizer (Text feature extraction)
Multinomial Naive Bayes (Classification Algorithm)

*WORKING PROCESS*:
1.Data Collection
The spam email dataset (spam.csv) was loaded using Pandas.

2.Data Preprocessing
The text data was cleaned and converted into numerical form using CountVectorizer.

3.Data Splitting
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

4.Model Training
The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the training data.

5.Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix

Prediction
The trained model was used to predict whether a new email message is spam or not.

*RESULTS*
The model successfully classified spam and ham messages with high accuracy. The performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score indicate that the model performs efficiently on unseen data.

*APPLICATIONS OF THIS PROJECT*:

This project can be used in:

1.Email filtering systems

2.Gmail/Yahoo spam detection

3.SMS spam filtering

4.Fraud message detection

5.Cybersecurity systems

6.Social media message moderation
